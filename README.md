## 🧠 Project Description

This repository presents the implementation of **EAGLE** – a hybrid AI-based protocol combining **Genetic Algorithm** (GA) for optimized cluster head selection and **Q-Learning** for intelligent routing decisions. The protocol is evaluated against the traditional **K-means clustering-based protocol** in terms of energy efficiency, fairness, and network lifetime.

> 📚 This work was developed as part of our Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence with a final grade of **18/20**.
